# Codepath - Week 5 - Facebook photos

This is the Week 5 submission for the [CodePath](http://www.codepath.com) course [iOS Bootcamp for designers](http://codepath.com/iosfordesigners).

This is an iOS demo application of the [Facebook app](https://www.facebook.com/) interface. 

Time spent: 16 hours

**Overview**
The purpose of this homework is to leverage animations and gestures to transition between screens. We're going to use the techniques from this week to implement some interactions in Facebook.

# Project Requirements - Completed

- [x] Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.
- [x] Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
- [  ] On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
- [  ] If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.
- [  ] Optional: The full screen photo should be zoomable.
- [  ] Optional: The user should be able to page through the other photos in full screen mode.
